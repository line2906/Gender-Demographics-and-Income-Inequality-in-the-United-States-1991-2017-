# Gender Ratio and Income Inequality in the United States

## Overview
This project examines whether changes in gender composition are associated with income inequality in the United States between 1991 and 2017.

## Research Question
Is variation in the female share of the population associated with changes in income inequality, after controlling for education spending, income concentration, taxation, and labour market conditions?

## Data
The analysis uses annual U.S. data from Our World in Data covering 1991–2017.

## Methodology
Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions are used to estimate the association between gender composition and income inequality. Robust standard errors are applied.

## Key Findings
- The female share of the population is negatively but not statistically significantly associated with income inequality.
- Government expenditure on education is significantly associated with lower inequality.
- The top 1% income share is a strong positive predictor of income inequality.

## Limitations
The analysis is correlational and does not identify causal effects. Results may be affected by small sample size and omitted variables.

## Reproducibility
All data processing, analysis, and figures can be reproduced using the scripts in the `code/` directory.
